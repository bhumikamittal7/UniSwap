I want to build a game where player starts by connecting metamask wallet and then play a quiz game to answer 5 questions. 
If all 5 questions are right, the user gets 0.5 ACS which will be minted using the token deplayment address and deposited to the player's metamask account. 
use the token contract address to mint the token and deposit to the player's metamask account.
